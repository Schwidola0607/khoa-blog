## About
I work in machine learning systems and semi-frequently blog or tweet about things. I also like to talk about hardware accelerators and model architecture even though I know next to nothing about them!

I am currently employed by an [AI coding agent company](https://www.augmentcode.com/) and has since become quite opinionated about AI coding
